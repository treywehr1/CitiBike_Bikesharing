# CitiBike Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview

Data collected from CitiBike bikesharing operations were collected into .csv format and manipulated within Python using Pandas and visualized in Tableau.
Areas such as gender-based demographic statistics and trip start/end/duration information were studied and reported on. 

### Trips By Week/Gender

- Clearly, Citibike usage is more commonly utilized by males. 
- The starting and ending weekdays (Mon,Tues - Thurs, Fri) are heavier traffic days. 
- Early mornings and early afternoons on any days are most common.
- These week-usage observations apply across all sexual orientations.

### Checkout Times / Checkout Times By Gender

- Trip durations/checkout times peak at around 5 hours and 45 minutes. 
- Male trip duration peaks at about this time whereas female trip duration peaks closer to 6 hours.

### Top Starting / Ending Locations

- Starting CitiBike locations are heavily clustered. However, there is a region farther Northeast from the city where starting locations seem to occur. 
- Ending locations seem to follow suit with slightly more common deviation.

## Conclusion

These initial visualizations would suggest that while mostly men use the CitiBike service, across the board the busiest usage occurs around the same parts of the week at the same times of day. 

Seeing as most americans have more free time over the weekends, one recommendation is to filter data to Friday-Sunday reporting and perform more usage analysis similar to those examined above in order to gain a clearer understanding of weekend usage, and down the road decide whether or not there is potential usage growth for weekend bikesharing.

Secondly, utilizing the User Type data (Subscription/Customer) might lend greater insights into potential market expansion. Number of customers compared to subscribers (and further exploration of this basic comparison) might tell us who who has been willing to use the service, and therefor might be willing to subscribe.
